GLOBAL SCOPE: 
		BOOLEAN: nextPlayer
		  Initialized: true
          PURPOSE: to ensure the same player doesn't play twice in a row

        ARRAY: boardState
          Initialized: 3 Arrays, each with 3 null's
          PURPOSE: to keep track of the board outside of the DOM

METHODS: 5
	play: function
		ARGS: 1
			box: DOM object 
			PURPOSE: Give acccess to box object (clicked) 
	    RETURN: undefined

        VARIABLE1: row
            Initialized: Value of row attribute in DOM box element, accessing by parent 
            
        VARIABLE2: column
            Initialized: Value of column attribute in DOM box element.

	    BEHAVIOR: This function is reading the user's input, which box did they click. If the clicked square was empty, it updates boardstate according to nextPlayer & the user input (ie which square). If the square was filled, it doesn't place the move and tell the user their move is invalid. It calls populateBoard to update the UI. It is switching to next player.
      

		PURPOSE: First it checks if someone did win. If someone did win it redraws board with all changes.
    
    populateBoard: function
        ARGS:0
        VARIABLE1: board

    winner: function
        ARGS: 1
        checkBoardState: two dimensional array with states
        Purpose: Check when someone wins
        BEHAVIOR: It calls two times function boxCheck with parameters 'x' and 'o' to check if there is a winning pattern for any of them. 
        METHODS: 1
            boxCheck: function
                ARGS: 1
