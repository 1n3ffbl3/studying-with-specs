play function
        FULL BEHAVIOR: If null equals to boardState at row [row] and column [column] than depending on state (true/false) of nextPlayer it assigns the value of "x" or "o" into boardState[row][column]. After assignment it toggles nextPlayer. 
		Then refresh the board by calling function populateBoard.
		If boardState from box.id is not equal null,then it shows alert message.

Changed variables in populateBoard function:
 - "i" is changed to "row"
 - "j" is changed to "col"
I did it to make code more selfexplanating. 

 populateBoard function
    BEHAVIOR : It populates the board for tictactoe game by iterating over all elements of boardState array and assigning its value to concrete field on the board by putting value of boardState[row][col] into document.getElementById(elementID).innerHTML property.
    Then incrementing elementID by one. (Both iterators have to be less than 3 of the sides in the board).
