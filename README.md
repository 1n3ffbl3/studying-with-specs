# TIC TAC TOE MVC lesson
This series of mini-projects builds up to a uselessly simple tictactoe board.  But that's just fine, we're here to learn.  

To get the most out of this lesson, we recommend you follow these steps:
0. Set aside at least a half-hour to get your head in the game.  To learn the most from these examples  you need to study them in a very special way, it'll take a little getting-used-to but it's totally worth your time.
1. Read up on what specs are (link)
2. Read through /0-how-to-use-these(link).  This folder explains the best way to study this series of projects.
3. Then for each folder you should:
	1. Read, run and try to understand the code provided
	2. Write specs for the code in the provided specs-X.md file.
	3. Hide the original code and try to rebuild it in my-code-X.js using only your specs.
	5. Take some notes on what you just learned. Be sure to note what changed from the last version and what that change did for the application. Then move on to the next folder.
  
By the time you're finished, you'll hopefully have a better understanding of MVC architecture.  More importantly, I hope you'll have a new appreciation for how helpful specs are to learning code.
