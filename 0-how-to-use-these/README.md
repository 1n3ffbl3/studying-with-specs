## Guide to studying with specs.

Writing specs is one of the best ways to understand new code. But it takes a little practice before you'll notice the benefits.  This folder is is a little guide for how to get the most out of studying new code.


There are four steps to study-speccing, and they are:

1: read the code, run the code, get what it does.  
2: write specs for the code  
3: put away the original code and write "empty code" for your specs.   
4: fill in your empty code.  don't look at the original code! 
  
In this folder you'll find an introduction to specs, and an example of all four study steps.

Happy learning!
