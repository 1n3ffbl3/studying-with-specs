 GLOBAL SCOPE: 
		BOOLEAN: nextPlayer
		  Initialized: true
          PURPOSE: to ensure the same player doesn't play twice in a row

        ARRAY: boardState
          Initialized: 3 Arrays, each with 3 null's
          PURPOSE: to keep track of the board outside of the DOM

METHODS: 4
	play: function
		ARGS: 1
			box: DOM object 
			PURPOSE: Give acccess to box object
	    RETURN: undefined

        VARIABLE1: row
            Initialized: Value of row attribute in DOM box element, accessed by parent element of column 
            
        VARIABLE2: column
            Initialized: Value of column attribute in DOM box element.

		BEHAVIOR: If null equals to boardState from two variables than it assigns different values according to nextPlayer.Then it toggles nextPlayer. If not it shows alert.
      
		PURPOSE: It checks if the move of player is correct.
    
    populateBoard: function
        ARGS:0
        VARIABLE1: board
            Initialized: From DOM we have to take table(parent element) and then tbody (which might be first or second child) and children of this tbody.
        VARIABLE2: row
            Initialized: undefined
        VARIABLE3: column
            Initialized: undefined

        RETURN: undefined

        PURPOSE: It writes the boardState into the html. 

        BEHAVIOR: It populates the board for tictactoe game with boardState. It assigns all the rows, which are stored in HTMLCollection (table -> tbody -> [tr, tr, tr]), to board variable. 
        

    buildBoard: function
        ARGS:0
        VARIABLE1: board
        Initialized: From DOM we have to take table element by his id.

        VARIABLE2: row
        Initialized: undefined

        VARIABLE3: cell
        Initialized: undefined

    BEHAVIOR: We declare all variables that are specified. For each row, we add a row to the board at given index and assign return value to row variable. Additionally we add row attribute with current index. We iterate n-times, where n is defined as number of columns per row. In each iteration we create a cell and assign the return value to cell variable. In next lines we set innerHTML prop of cell corresponding state in boardState array. After that we add two attributes.

    
    OBJECT: window
        Purpose: Reference to window object
        
    BEHAVIOR:  It uses method which adds a listener on 'DOMContentLoaded' event and creates new function which calls buildBoard function.
